# Projects
### Yonder Dynamics
Member of UCSD’s University Rover Competition team. Lead rover’s networking as a member of the electrical engineering team. Set up an onboard DNS and DHCP server to simplify communication between IP devices. Implemented low latency video streaming using v4l2, Gstreamer, WebRTC, and Janus-Gateway on a Jetson Nano embedded development board. See more [here](https://yonderdynamics.org/#/)

### Home Networking/Servers
Setup and maintain routing and firewall rules using pfSense. Ubuntu Linux server hosting a DNS-over-HTTPS proxy, along with a DNS-based ad blocker, media server, and VPN server.

### 802.11 PHY implementation in Matlab
A class project to implement a 802.11 PHY layer, with some simplifications. Included OFDM Modulation of data, using STF for detection, and LTF for channel estimation.

### Python to WASM Compiler, in browser
A class project to allow for Python code to be compiled to Web Assembly in browser, and then run. Specifically worked on Closures, first class functions, lambdas, nested functions, and if expressions.

### CPU Design Project Classes
ECE 141L: Worked in a team of two to design our own 16-bit Instruction Set Architecture, create a CPU that runs the architecture in Verilog, and made an assembler in Haskell. We then simulated our CPU running simple programs in ModelSim.
CSE 148: Modified a MIPS CPU to have more pipeline stages, implemented register renaming, implemented a simple out-of-order execution, and implemented a branch predictor.

### Networking Class Projects
Implement a Internet Protocol router in C in a Mininet environment. Implemented minimum viable ARP and ICMP messages. Also implemented sender and receiver with sliding window and re-transmission.
